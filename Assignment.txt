# Assignment Prog. Movel

## Description
For this assignment you are required to create an Android App client, for a web app that exposes a JSON REST API that allows for GET and POST requests.

## Scenario
Suppose that you have a webapp/website at the address http://www.facebook.com and that it has an API exposed at http://www.facebook.com/api/v2, 
 - to get all the posts from this webapp you will need to access the following http://www.facebook.com/api/v2/posts
 - to get a specific post you will need to access the following http://www.facebook.com/api/v2/posts/postid
 - to get comments for a specific post you will need to access the following http://www.facebook.com/api/v2/comments/postid
 Note that each website/webapp has different structure.
 For each of the project, you will have to work closely with your lecturer to help you understand how the specific site works.
